Reblog and follow tumblr links in the queue of a (fictive) kubricklove.tumblr.com

Important : you have to create your tumblr and config oauth

kubricklove_reblog.rb :
For each tumblr link, it send the link in tumblr queue with tags and title, add the tumblr author and the source of post in tofollow file, and search in the post content if there is any link to follow or to add to external links.

Please note this tumblr doesn't exist and oauth in config yaml is empty
You can copy this example and make it work by replacing "kubricklove" by your tumblr name and set valid oauth in config file 

To config oauth please follow the tumblr documentation (your tumblr must give the authorization to the application) : http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#blog-likes
